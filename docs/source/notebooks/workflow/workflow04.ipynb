    "# HIL testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous part](workflow03.md) of this series we designed a control algorithm for the system and evaluated it with a fairly detailed simulation, including sensor and actuator models resolved to I/O voltage levels.\n",
    "Finally, we used the [`codegen`](#archimedes.codegen) function to output a portable C implementation of the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we are substantially done with the \"Python environment\" part of our workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} _static/dev_workflow.png\n",
    ":class: only-light\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} _static/dev_workflow_dark.png\n",
    ":class: only-dark\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle we have everything we need to deploy to the microcontroller and directly test on the physical system.\n",
    "However, here we'll add one last validation step: hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why HIL?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of HIL testing is to run the actual control logic on the actual microcontroller and supply it realistic I/O in real time to test behavior in various scenarios.\n",
    "If the performance meets requirements the real-time simulator can be simply swapped out for the physical system with no changes at all to the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} _static/hil_diagram.png\n",
    ":class: only-light\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} _static/hil_diagram_dark.png\n",
    ":class: only-dark\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we separately simulated the idealized continuous-time controller and the discretized logic in order to distinguish between any issues with the theoretical control law and the digital implementation, HIL testing lets us pinpoint any new problems when we actually deploy to the microcontroller hardware (peripheral configuration, ADC sampling noise, timing latency or jitter, etc.).\n",
    "This gives us additional confidence in the controller, particularly in safety- or mission-critical scenarios that are difficult to create in physical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, implementing HIL simulation does add some initial development complexity.\n",
    "In particular, we need a real-time implementation of the plant model and a way to run it in real time and interface with the controller, reading actuator signals and mocking sensor voltages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This often means time-intensive translation of the physics model from the simulation framework to optimized C/C++ code, which then requires its own maintenance to ensure it corresponds to the latest version of the simulation.\n",
    "With Archimedes, we can make use of the same codegen framework we used to deploy the controller code to auto-generate a real-time plant model directly from the Python simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the DC motor, the \"full-fidelity\" model is more than fast enough for real time, but for more complex systems you could even develop a hierarchy of Python models using modular multi-fidelity components and/or reduced-order modeling techniques.\n",
    "The high-fidelity models can be used for initial simulations, and then you can automatically generate real-time-ready code from the reduced-order variants for HIL testing.\n",
    "This paradigm lets you leverage the power and convenience of modern Python-based software development - virtual environments, version control, automated testing frameworks, CI/CD tools, etc. - for hardware development workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware for the plant model\n",
    "\n",
    "The final requirement for HIL testing is a real-time simulation platform.\n",
    "Traditionally, this has meant purpose-built commercial systems that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars.\n",
    "While these systems are powerful and capable, the cost and complexity of working with them typically relegates HIL testing to late-stage validation and regulatory compliance verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not every HIL testing application requires this kind of sophistication.\n",
    "In our case we have a 10 kHz control loop, meaning the plant model needs to run at least that fast with very precise (sub-microsecond) timing.\n",
    "The timing requirements make typical Unix distributions impractical for this use case - even with a specialized real-time kernel you'd still need a dedicated workstation, very high-speed communication, and external D/A conversion to generate the simulated sensor voltages.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the model itself is not very complicated compared to modern microcontrollers like the ARM Cortex line.\n",
    "At the same time, the most demanding part of the requirements relates to timing and speed, which is where bare-metal microcontrollers shine.\n",
    "This suggests that instead of purchasing or developing a complex workstation-based HIL system, we can build a simple, low-cost DIY version using a second STM32 Nucleo board.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second \"simulation\" board will run the same plant model we simulated in [Part 3](workflow03.md), translated to C using the same [`codegen`](#archimedes.codegen) functionality used to deploy the controller.\n",
    "We can use the onboard D/A conversion to generate \"analog\" sensor voltages and the GPIO pins to output simulated encoder pulses.\n",
    "This eliminates most of the electronics, except for a couple of simple RC filters for signal conditioning (e.g. smoothing out the PWM signal).\n",
    "But, since all the inputs and outputs are in the same configuration and range as the physical system from the perspective of the controller board, once we're satisfied with the performance in HIL testing we can simply swap these connections to test on the physical hardware.\n",

    "### Implementation notes\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be worth comparing the C application code for the \"step response\" from Part 2 ([source](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/tree/main/docs/source/notebooks/workflow/stm32/step_response/Core/Src/main.c)) with the closed-loop implementation here ([source](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/tree/main/docs/source/notebooks/workflow/stm32/controller/Core/Src/main.c)).\n",
    "The two are largely the same, so the differences mainly come from the use of the Archimedes-generated controller logic.\n",
    "Again, this provides a clear division of responsibilities for whose job it is to worry about the controller logic vs. the embedded implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other differences from the open-loop characterization test that are worth noting in this configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have to tell CMake about the Archimedes-generated code.  Since CubeMX will not overwrite an existing `CMakeLists.txt` file, this can be done as a one-time boilerplate (see [here](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/tree/main/docs/source/notebooks/workflow/stm32/controller/CMakeLists.txt) and [here](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/tree/main/docs/source/notebooks/workflow/stm32/controller/cmake/archimedes/CMakeLists.txt) for examples of the two files that need to be edited/created).\n",
    "- You can either power the plant board using a separate USB connection, or by daisy-chaining and powering from the +5V output of the controller board to the E5V pin of the plant (as shown in the schematic above).  In the latter case, make sure to set the power jumper (JP3 on this board) to the appropriate position for external power.\n",
    "- This HIL test configuration can't output nonzero `VOUTB` values (corresponding to direction reversal) because there are only two onboard DAC channels. We'd just need to incorporate an external DAC chip to expand this, but the VOUT is just a diagnostic reading and isn't used by the controller anyway. As we'll see, direction reversals are still handled properly by both the plant and controller boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things as simple as possible, this particular HIL testing setup is also configured so that all data logging is done on the controller side.\n",
    "Depending on your application, you may want to collect additional data from the plant board as well (for instance, internal model variables that aren't measured by any \"sensors\").\n",
    "To do this you would simply need to allocate storage arrays on the plant board and arrange to transmit them back to the computer in addition to any data logged by the controller.\n"

    "## Deploying and running\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is essentially identical to what we did in Part 2, except that now we need to deploy to the plant board first.\n",
    "To do this, ensure that the plant board is connected by USB (and the power jumper is set appropriately), and then use the CMake/OpenOCD toolchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd stm32/plant\n",
    "cmake --preset=Release && cmake --build --preset=Release\n",
    "openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg \\\n",
    "        -c \"program build/Release/motor_plant.elf verify reset exit\"\n",
    "cd ../..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After flashing or resetting, the plant model will reset to a zero state with no inputs.\n",
    "That is, it will sit and wait for the controller to do anything, so we can always get a fresh physical state by just pressing the RESET button on the plant board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, switch USB connections to the controller board (and swap the power jumper for the plant board to E5V if necessary), and repeat the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd stm32/controller\n",
    "cmake --preset=Release && cmake --build --preset=Release\n",
    "openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg \\\n",
    "        -c \"program build/Release/motor_controller.elf verify reset exit\"\n",
    "cd ../..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the controller will be waiting for the \"trigger\" signal (the onboard USER button).\n",
    "Before launching the test sequence, start the Python serial communications script to receive the data from the controller:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python serial_receive.py --save hil_data.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you see `\"Waiting for experiment data...\"` you can press the USER button to trigger the test.\n",
    "The controller will follow a command to move to a position of 1 rad for 250 ms, and then back to home for 250 ms, testing the step response performance and direction reversal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to re-run the tests, just remember to reset both boards so that the state of the plant model is reset along with the controller."

    "\n",
    "To better understand the advantages of this kind of incremental testing protocol (continuous time simulation, then full simulated discrete logic, then HIL testing, then deployment), here's a quick anecdote to help illustrate the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses a simple PI feedback controller, but the first iteration of this series was based on a more complicated cascaded control approach using an inner current control loop nested in an outer position control loop.\n",
    "This incorporates the additional sensor information from the current sense output, and could in principle lead to improved controller performance.\n",
    "The control laws for both loops were designed with internal model control, \n",
