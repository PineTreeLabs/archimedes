# End-to-End Controller Development

Controller development can be a messy process involving a patchwork of software tools, hardware configurations, and algorithm parameters - but it doesn't need to be.
Pure software development often follows a highly structured process designed to ensure both reliability of the output _and_ engineering efficiency.
While hardware development by its nature will always be a harder beast than pure software, we can take inspiration from these workflows to imagine a process with much less friction.

In this tutorial we will go through one such representative workflow to see how Python and Archimedes can act as a unifying high-level layer enabling a logical development progression.
