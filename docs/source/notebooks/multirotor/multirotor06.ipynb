    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've explored the capabilities of Archimedes through the lens of multirotor flight vehicle modeling. We've demonstrated how Archimedes can handle complex computational graphs efficiently, provided a proof-of-concept implementation for multirotor dynamics, and laid the groundwork for more advanced modeling and analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered the basics of multirotor flight vehicle modeling, including 6-dof rigid body dynamics and blade-element momentum theory for rotor aerodynamics. While the details of this model are fairly specific to this kind of flight vehicle, it represents a moderately complex physics model common in aerospace engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points from this tutorial include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A straightforward implementation of the model equations in NumPy easily ran with Archimedes, yielding a ~5x speedup in simulation.\n",
    "* Archimedes also enabled automatic differentiation for trim point identification and linear stability analysis, again with the same NumPy code\n",
    "* We saw the power and simplicity of the implicit function abstraction in Archimedes when implementing the momentum theory inflow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond illustrating multirotor flight vehicle modeling, this code (or a similar framework) can be the starting point for more advanced analysis and applications, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trajectory optimization to design optimal flight paths and control sequences\n",
    "* Parameter estimation for calibrating model parameters against test data\n",
    "* Advanced aerodynamics modeling like dynamic inflow or vortex particle methods\n",
    "* Design optimization with an XFOIL-type panel code to solve sectional aerodynamics for variable airfoil profiles\n",
    "* State estimation (IMU) algorithms and discrete control system design with automatic C code generation for hardware deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed the design of a modular and extensible modeling framework, combining a hierarchy of classes (inheritance) with nested callable classes that implement well-defined abstract interfaces (composition). By thoughtfully structuring the framework, we were able to add a significantly more complex component model (the blade-element model) while fully reusing our existing code. Similar principles can be applied to a wide range of physics models.\n",
