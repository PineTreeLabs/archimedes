    "# Deploying to Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of Archimedes is to provide a \"path to hardware\" from Python.  Importantly though, this does _not_ mean \"running Python on a microcontroller\".  For a variety of reasons, this is often not a viable approach, especially for safety- and mission-critical systems that require precise and deterministic memory and timing management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the workflow in Archimedes is to develop your _algorithms_ in Python, test them in simulation, then automatically translate them to efficient C implementations that are ready for deployment.\n",
    "The goal is to combine rapid Python development with the efficiency and determinism of compiled C code.\n",
    "This avoids both the performance limitations of education-oriented tools for running Python directly on microcontrollers and the labor-intensive process of manual Python-to-C translation.\n",

    "## Tutorial overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through a simple example of this process.  We will develop an IIR filter using SciPy's signal processing tools and generate code for deployment to an Arduino.  Although this is a simplified example, it illustrates the key steps of the Archimedes hardware deployment model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core workflow involves four pieces of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An Archimedes-compatible Python function (written by you)\n",
    "2. The embedded C application (written by you)\n",
    "3. A low-level C \"kernel\" implementation of the same function (generated automatically)\n",
    "4. An \"interface\" layer providing a consistent and easy-to-use API for the kernel code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get into the details later on.  For now, the key idea is that only the C code gets deployed to the target hardware, but you can modify the Python code to quickly make changes that automatically propagate to the C source code. This unlocks streamlined workflows for quickly moving from modeling, simulation, and analysis to deployment and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contains four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Quickstart**](deployment01)\n",
    "    - Overview of the full workflow\n",
    "    - Basic usage of the auto-generated API\n",
    "    - Minimal C application example\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Code Generation Basics**](deployment02)\n",
    "    - Converting Python functions to optimized C code\n",
    "    - Characteristics of the generated \"kernel\" code\n",
    "    - The CasADi API for generated C code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [**Interface Code Generation**](deployment03)\n",
    "    - Creating boilerplate code for calling generated C code\n",
    "    - Preserving modifications within protected regions\n",
    "    - Customizing generated code with the templating system\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [**Structured Data Types**](deployment04)\n",
    "    - Defining nested state, input, and output data types\n",
    "    - Mapping composite data types to C code\n",
    "    - Simplified memory management for stateful functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this tutorial, you'll need:\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python and NumPy\n",
    "- A Python environment with Archimedes installed\n",
    "- Understanding of C programming fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "No prior experience with CasADi or code generation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, one last comment: the full \"path to hardware\" includes not only code generation, but data acquisition and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing workflows.  These are central to the [development roadmap](../../../roadmap.md) - stay tuned for more on those capabilities soon.\n",
    "For a preview, also check out the [end-to-end controller workflow series](../workflow/workflow00.md).\n",
