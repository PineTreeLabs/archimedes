## A Python toolkit for hardware engineering

Hardware engineers have to be part hacker, part master craftsman.

You have to be a hacker because things rarely "just work" in the real world.
We all have or have heard stories of an unlikely-sounding last-minute fix that worked better than expected and kept a project (mostly) on schedule.
And if we're being honest, that's part of the excitement of working on hardware - it doesn't work and it doesn't work, and then you tweak something and it's like magic.

But if you're _just_ a hacker, you're unlikely to last long
